Que 4) why isnit it possible to see the first five rows of a table?
    ans=in some cases, there might be technical limitations due to the software or platform being    used. For instance, if the table is very large and the tool you're using doesn't efficiently handle large datasets, it might take a long time to display the first few rows or the tool might even crash.
